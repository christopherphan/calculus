# calculus

Author: Christopher L. Phan (cphan@chrisphan.com)

This repository contains some course materials I've developed for teaching calculus
such as the standard two-semester sequence for math, science, and engineering
students, as well as the applied calculus course.

(At the moment, it is quite empty, but my intention is to periodically add
materials.)
